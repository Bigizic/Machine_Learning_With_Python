Contains solution to credit card fraud detection using scikit-learn and snap ML libraries

### Models used:

- [X] Decision Trees
- [X] Support Vector Machine


The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards.


You will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.


## Introduction:

Imagine that you work for a financial institution and part of your job is to build a model that predicts if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. You can model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).


You have access to transactions that occured over a certain period of time. The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced.

To train the model, you can use part of the input dataset, while the remaining data can be utilized to assess the quality of the trained model.
