## Logistic Regression with Python

### What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?

``While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.``

``Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, used when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.``

#### Customer churn with Logistic Regression

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.
